## Pandora's Box

NOTE: You will need to clone both this Pi repo and the server repo at (https://github.com/pandoras-box/Server) and the client repo at (https://github.com/pandoras-box/Client)

### Summary
Pandora's Box is a mobile app and Internet of Things project designed to streamline and gamify Interactions with parents and children on the subject of chores or tasks. It sets up a system where there is a tangible reward controlled by the mobile application.

Parents create tasks remotely and approve them but the kids ultimately get the satisfaction of remotely opening the box to get their reward.
